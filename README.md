# ðŸ§  ML â€“ My Machine Learning Practices & Projects

Welcome to my **ML playground** ðŸš€  
This is where I learn, experiment, and build with **Machine Learning projects** â€” from scratch implementations to full-fledged projects.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What You'll Find Here
- Step-by-step implementations of core ML algorithms
- Hands-on projects applying ML to real-world datasets
- Well-documented Jupyter notebooks for easy learning

---

## ðŸ“š Roadmap
- [x] Linear Regression
- [x] Logistic Regression
- [ ] Support Vector Machines
- [ ] Decision Trees
- [ ] Random Forest
- [ ] Neural Networks
- [ ] Deep Learning Projects
